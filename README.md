### 1. Dashboard Overview

High-Level Summary: Show a clean overview with key metrics like the number of tests, recent test executions, and success/failure rates.

Search and Filters: Allow users to quickly find tests by name, tag, status, or date of creation. Quick Actions: Buttons for “Create New Test,” “Run All Tests,” or “View Test Results” should be prominent.

### 2.Test Creation Wizard
Drag-and-Drop Editor: A central area where users can drag predefined blocks (e.g., "Input Text", "Click Button", "Validate Output") into a timeline or flow chart. Each block can represent a step in the test case.
   
Reusable Components: Let users save steps or sequences of steps (like logging in) as reusable components, making test creation faster.

Contextual Help & Hints: Tooltips and inline guidance to explain what each step/block does and how to configure it.

### 3.Test Case Configuration
Step-by-Step Breakdown: Each step in the test is visually represented in a sequential or flow-based manner, with icons or labels describing what happens at each stage.
   
Editable Properties: Clicking on any step reveals a side panel with editable properties (e.g., which button to click, which text field to input, etc.).
   
Parameterization Support: Add parameters for dynamic data inputs. A drop-down or simple form to insert test data for each step.

### 4. Test Maintenance and Versioning
Inline Edit/Update Capabilities: A user can edit tests directly from the dashboard or editor interface. Changes can be committed or discarded in real-time.
   
Version Control: Each test case should have versioning. Users can compare different versions of a test and roll back to previous versions if needed.
   
Smart Suggestions: If the interface detects that certain tests fail repeatedly or if an element (like a button or URL) has changed, it suggests automatic updates or provides hints for resolving issues.

### 5. Test Execution Control
Test Playback/Recording: A feature to record user interactions with an application and convert those into test steps automatically.
   
Test Environment Selection: Dropdown or toggle to choose the environment (development, staging, production) where the test will run.
   
Real-Time Feedback: Show a progress bar and real-time logs during test execution, allowing users to spot issues immediately.

### 6. Error Reporting and Debugging
Inline Error Indicators: If a test fails, highlight the exact step that caused the error with detailed error messages.
   
Visual Replay of Test: Let users watch a replay of the test execution to see exactly where things went wrong.
   
Debug Mode: A mode where users can step through each test step, pausing to inspect elements, data inputs, and outputs.

### 7. Collaboration and Sharing
Commenting and Notes: Add comments to test cases or specific steps for other team members to see.
   
Test Sharing: Allow users to share tests or test suites with others via direct links or exports (e.g., sharing tests with stakeholders or other team members).
